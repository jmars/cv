# CV
A simple digital CV for myself.

## Why Elm?
Because I find elm to be unique in it's simplicity, there is one way to do things and only one. And you have to work hard to produce something of poor quality.

## Ok but why Elm Pages?
A CV is basically a brochure site, static site generation greatly simplifies deployment and hosting.

## Why build this at all? Why not generate a PDF from Word or use Wix or Webflow?
Well, you can generate a PDF from a web page too, and my strength is web technologies, not producing word documents.
As for WYSIWYG editors, it would be a bit odd for a programmer to build software with tools intended for non-programmers.
